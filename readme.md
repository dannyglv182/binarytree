## Project by Daniel Galvez
## C++

This project performs operations on a binary tree and clears dynamic memory when the program closes.

Operations include:
1. Creating a pseudo-random tree
2. Finding and returning the height of the tree
3. Removing a single item from the tree
4. Removing all items from the tree.
5. Clearing dynamic memory when the program closes
